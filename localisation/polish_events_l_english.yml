 poland.53.d:0 "The right-wing National Democracy party's power base was in western Poland. Its main idealogue was Roman Dmowski who had the backing of many ethnically Polish intelligentsia, the urban lower middle class, some elements of the greater middle class, and its extensive youth movement. In the mid 1930s, a rift grew between the new and old generations of the party which fragmented the nationalist movement into many small successor parties. One of the most extreme nationalist splinter groups was the National Radical Camp (ONR). The ONR-Falanga is a fringe political party popular among small academic circles on Polish university campuses. They have always been considered an extremist nuisance by the Sanacja government, and their meetings have been broken up by Polish police several times. Today, however, they held an extremely large public rally in defiance of the Sanacja government. How shall we deal with them?"

 poland.54.d:0 "Until the end of the Great War, Poland had been partitioned between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Upon Poland's independence, the rural eastern regions once part of the Russian Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire still retained a large agricultural sector. The great depression hit the region especially hard. With unemployment reaching above 40% in some areas and the propect of hunger looming, frustration often fed radicalism. Today another strike was organized by the Agrarian People's Party with some backing by the Polish Socialist Party. Already it has spread to multiple cities.

 poland.59.t:0 "The Front Morges"
 poland.59.d:0 "While well-loved as the father and protector of Poland's independence, Józef Piłsudski's May 1926 Coup d'État against the Second Republic was not met with approval everywhere. Many opposed the turn away from democracy, and those who did often found themselves marginalized or forced into political exile. Among these detractors, the Front Morges was a political alliance of centrist political parties of interwar Poland. It was founded in 1936 in the Swiss village of Morges by general Władysław Sikorski along with former Polish Prime Minister and famous composer Ignacy Paderewski. Prominent activists included general Józef Haller and former Deputy Prime Minister Wojciech Korfanty. Their primary aim was to reinstate democracy, align diplomatically with France, and elect Wicenty Witos as Prime Minister and Paderewski as president."

 poland.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] Declines"
 poland.62.d:0 "Despite many attempts, [From.GetLeader] stated that he did not want to drag [From.GetName] into foreign entanglements. Although intrigued at the idea, [From.GetLeader] also insisted that he must look after the interests of [From.GetName] first and foremost."

 poland.63.t:0 "Diplomatic Mission to France"

 poland.67.d:0 "France has agreed to sell us the colony of Madagascar. Already an expedition by Polish Army Major Mieczyslaw Lepecki has been sent to survey the area. We should make sure we have an international port and a proper merchant marine navy if we want to extract its resources to the fullest extent."
 poland.67.a:0 "Poland can into colonies!"
 poland.68.t:0 "Proposal to France Declined"
 poland.68.d:0 "The French government has declined our offer whether it be for fear of our intentions, our allies, or simple mistrust."
 poland.68.a:0 "We will just buy up French investments instead."
 poland.70.t:0 "The Sanation Right"
 poland.70.d:0 "In the power vacuum left by Józef Piłsudski's death and the recent April Constitution reforms, the Sanation Right headed by Edward Rydz-Śmigły has managed to maneuver into a position of power by taking advantage of the feuds in the ruling elite.\n\nEdward Rydz-Śmigły is known throughout Poland as a masterful commander in the Polish-Soviet War, having conducted many successful offensives against the Bolsheviks, including the initial capture of Wilno, Dünaburg, and, as Commander-in-Chief of the Latvian armed forces, the province of Latgale. In those most dire moments as Poland's capital found itself besieged by the Red Army, the Central Front under Rydz-Śmigły's leadership held firm in the battle of Warsaw and played in instrumental role in blocking the escape of the Red Army from encirclement.\n\nAfter the Polish-Soviet war's conclusion, Rydz-Śmigły became the Inspector General of the Polish Army in the Wilno district and later the Warsaw district. When Piłsudski launched his 1926 coup d'état, Rydz-Śmigły offered his full support. As a reward for his loyalty, Piłsudski appointed Rydz-Śmigły to Marshal Deputy of all matters concerning the East. In accordance with Piłsudski's final wishes after his passing, Rydz-Śmigły was appointed as Inspector-General of the Polish Armed Forces, the highest Polish military office."
 poland.70.a:0 "Now onto the present."
 poland.71.t:0 "Consolidation of the Government"
 poland.71.d:0 "With Walery Sławek marginalised as a serious political player, Ignacy Mościcki outmaneuvered, and with many supporters of the Camp of National Unity in positions of power, the question remains on how to deal with the rest of the ruling elite."
 poland.71.a:0 "Conclude a power-sharing agreement with President Ignacy Mościcki."
 poland.71.b:0 "Dissolve the Sejm and take full power."
 poland.72.t:0 "Power Sharing Agreement"
 poland.72.d:0 "Ignacy Mościcki is a useful ally especially in managing the economic affairs of the country, and he provides a means of retaining many talented connections. In a grand ceremony held today, President Mościcki presented Edward Rydz-Śmigły with the Marshal's baton, elevating him to the special rank only once held by Józef Piłsudski. Edward Rydz-Śmigły is now the Second Marshal of Poland. Much of the elite is bitter about the decision to recreate such a title, but grudgingly they fall in line. Although the state press declares that Marshal Rydz-Śmigły is the 'Second Man in the State after the President' as a mouthpiece of propaganda to placate the public, the truth is that the President holds little power with the Marshal now at the reigns."
 poland.72.a:0 "The new first soldier of the 'Republic.'"
 poland.73.t:0 "Dissolution of the Sejm"
 poland.73.d:0 "In an emergency session addressing the Sejm, Edward Rydz-Śmigły announced before a jeering audience that the dissolution of the legistlative body would be imminent effectively ending the Second Republic. Edward Rydz-Śmigły proclaimed himself the Second Marshal of Poland and that he—like Józef Piłsudski—will safeguard the nation against all threats. Unlike Piłsudski though, Rydz-Śmigły claims that he will go all the way to ensure that the corruption of government cannot manifest itself under the guise of democratic bodies. The military, already heavily involved in government affairs, will now run the nation entirely. Although the general public is also shocked at the sudden turn of events, the state press is already drawing patriotic comparison's between Marshal Rydz-Śmigły's recent coup d'état against a corrupt elite and Józef Piłsudski's May Coup against a perceived corrupt system."
 poland.73.a:0 "The leader of the new Polish State."
 poland.74.t:0 "Diplomatic Report"
 poland.74.d:0 "Relations between the Polish government and the Free City of Danzig have long been tenuous. During the Polish-Soviet war in early 1920s and the German embargo against Poland in 1925, dockyard workers in Gdansk twice refused to unload supplies off of Polish ships. Such concerns over the economic security of Poland led to the impetus behind the creation of the nearby seaport of Gdynia. In 1933, the local branch of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NDSAP) was elected into power. Tensions flared again over Danzig's seperation from Germany and over the city's oppressive treatment of the Polish minority within its borders.\n\nIn a recent diplomatic meeting between Józef Beck, Polish 'Minister of Foreign Affairs', and Joachim von Ribbentrop, German 'Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs', a mutual concensus was finally reached. Adolf Hitler has instructed the local Nazi government to cease anti-Polish actions. In return we have promised to not support the actions of the anti-Nazi opposition in Danzig. Though the issue of the cty's status remains far from settled, our recent rapprochement has yielded some positive results."
 poland.74.a:0 "Its best to keep aloof from internal Danzig problems."
 poland.75.t:0 "Foreign Relations Report"
 poland.75.d:0 "Shortly after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Józef Piłsudski entered Poland into a non-agression pact with Germany on January 26, 1934. Germany agreed to recongize Poland's current borders and halt the damaging customs war that had lasted almost a decade. Józef Piłsudski correctly deduced that the French military would assume a purely defensive posture in the event of war and leave their eastern allies to their own fate. The French construction of the Maginot line starting in 1929 and subsequent French refusal to pressure Germany only reinforced his views.\n\nJózef Piłsudski, however, incorrectly believed that such a pact would eliminate the danger that Poland would be the first target of German aggression. German diplomatic efforts at the time often seemed to suggest favorability to Poland especially as a hegemonic partner against the Soviet Union. Józef Piłsudski still distrusted Hitler but thought that his Austrian ancestry would help mitigate Germany's past icy relations with Poland—contrary to what had been the previous 'Anti-Polish Prussian-sort' of politicians. An opening of trade relations followed, but such friendly offerings were secretly and purposely intended as a ruse to lure the Poles into a false sense of security."
 poland.75.a:0 "But surely we can avoid war in this timeline, right?"
 poland.76.t:0 "The Changing Political Climate"
 poland.76.d:0 "In 1938, the open diplomatic situation between Germany and Poland changed dramatically. On October 1938, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop demanded that the Free City of Danzig be returned to Germany with the construction of a highway and railroad link through the Polish corridor to Prussia. In turn, Germany would agree to respect Poland's current borders. While the proposal for a highway link had been floated in the past between Ribbentrop and Beck, such plans were rejected by the Polish government who feared that acceptance would lead to more demands from Germany and the erosion of Poland's independence as a nation. Soon after, Adolf Hitler pressed more demands against the Polish state demanding that they accept 'German consultation on foreign policy'. The Polish government's fears became a reality."
 poland.76.a:0 "We have chosen to give in, but only in exchange for their protection."
 poland.77.t:0 "Poland Seeks to Join the Axis"
 poland.77.d:0 "Polish Foreign Minister of Affairs, Józef Beck, has informed us that the Polish government is willing to transfer the Free City of Danzig to us and accept our consultation of their foreign policy. In exchange for these concessions, the Polish government is asking for us to guarantee Poland's existing borders and sign a pact offering protection against the Soviet threat and against any other potential aggressors. How shall we respond?"
 poland.77.a:0 "Excellent."
 poland.77.b:0 "Our demands are not negotiable."
 poland.78.t:0 "The Ribbentrop-Beck Pact"
 poland.78.d:0 "The German government has accepted the deal. A new chapter in our history is beginning as we tie our fate to Germany. Though still independent, we have agreed to follow and cooperate with German foreign policy."
 poland.78.a:0 "Hopefully we can still maintain our independence."
 poland.79.t:0 "Germany Declines"
 poland.79.d:0 "The German government has declined our offer stating that their demands are not negotiable, and that they are unwilling to sign a pact that binds them to come to our aid in times of war. It can only be concluded that we are an immediate target for their aggression."
 poland.79.a:0 "This is justifiable cause for the mobilization of our military."
 poland.80.t:0 "Polish-French Relations"
 poland.80.d:0 "During the Polish-Soviet war, France sent a military mission of 400 officers to Poland. The efforts of the French delegation yielded strong positive results for the organization and logistics of the fledgling Polish army. Shortly after the war's conclusion, a military pact was signed to contain the dual threats of Germany and the Soviet Union. France was obliged to help Poland economically, but was not required declare war if Poland found itself under attack. But with the threat of German rearmanent and aggression looming, the Kasprzycki-Gamelin Convention was signed on May 19, 1939 in Paris. The treaty was named after 'Polish Minister of War Affairs' General Tadeusz Kasprzycki and 'Commander of the French Army' Maurice Gamelin. Both countries were now fully bound together in the event of conflict.\n\nToday we have asked the French to go one step further and preemptively strike at Germany. [Root.GetLeader] has flown to France seeking to build concensus on the German threat and win support for early retaliatory action."

 poland.86.d:0 "Piłsudski himself was never interested in elevating himself or creating a mythos surrounding his legacy. One famous quote attributed to the late Marshal is\n\n'I am not going to dictate to you what you write about my life and work. I only ask that you not make me out to be a 'whiner and sentimentalist.'\n\nThe Sanacja government though saw the Marshal's legacy as a useful propaganda tool. Immediately after his death, state media praised him as a brilliant strategist, statesman, visionary, and the father of Poland's independence. School children sang songs and wrote poems commemorating the late Marshal, public rallies and celebrations were organized, statues and great artworks were erected in public places, and 'Polish Independence Day' was declared a national holiday in his honor. Public initiatives to rename streets, towns, and military regiments after his name were widespread. In 1938, the Polish parliament even went so far as to make defaming Piłsudski's name illegal. The cult surrounding Piłsudski was especially popular within the military, and the tradition continued even among the Army in Exile in the West despite Władysław Sikorski's and other detractor's objections. March 19, the day after Piłsudski's birthday, was named Marshal Day where high level military promotions were awarded publically."

 poland.87.t:0 "Rydz-Śmigły's State Propaganda Apparatus"
 poland.87.d:0 "Initially, Rydz-Śmigły tried to portray himself as a man above politics and above political associations; however, overtime Rydz-Śmigły gave increasingly political and passionate public speeches. State propaganda tried to portry him as Piłsudski's heir, and his prominence eclipsed that of the president. Posters, public buildings, and bulletin boards portrayed his athletic pose, tall height, and confident but gentle smile. As the prospect of war loomed, his popularity reached its zenith. State propaganda, which included adulatory songs, poetry, and almost daily revelations about his life in the press, were a means to distract the masses from the dire economic situation that beset the country and the foreign policy failings of the new regime. Poland's swift defeat in 1939 came as a thunderous shock to the public who believed that between Rydz-Śmigły's guiding hand and the help of the Western Allies, Germany would be quickly defeated."

Piłsudski envisioned the army and the cavalry as the dominant force on the future battlefield and neglected to invest heavily in the aviation branch. Edward Rydz-Śmigły saw otherwise and believed the air force would play an important role in the upcoming conflict. A large investment program in the air force and the army aviation branch soon followed. Funding for aircraft development, training, and support was increased; and with these developments, Polish doctrine was revised to envision air support as a rapid response unit for critical emergency situations rather than a scattered tactical asset."

 poland.90.t:0 "Polish Military Aviation Exports"
 poland.90.d:0 "In 1933, the all metal fighter design, Zygmunt Pulawsk's PZL P.7a, was introduced. This was soon followed by the more developed PZL P.11a and PZL P.11c which were among the most advanced fighters in the world at the time of their introduction in 1934 and 1935 respectively. With the advent of the Great Depression, budget shortcomings meant that aircraft designs had to be available for export to fund the military. Additional aircraft models such as the P.11b, P.24A, P.24B, P.24G, and PZL.43 Karaś light bomber were superior in specification but produced exclusively for export and not for Poland's own military. Hundreds of aircraft were instead sold abroad to various countries. Buyers of interwar Polish fighter aircraft and light reconnaissance bombers included Greece, Portugal, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Republican Spain, Hungary, and Romania. Even after Poland's capitulation in 1939, Polish aircraft were still operated, produced, and developed upon abroad. When operation Barbarossa began, just under half of Romania's airforce consisted of Polish planes, and the domestic IAR 80 fighter was a development of the Polish P.24E."

 poland.91.t:0 "The April Constitution"
 poland.91.d:0 "The April Constitution's main idealogue was Walery Slawek, and its drafting would lead to controversy between the Sanation Left and the Castle faction over who would hold the position of the presidency. In its articles, the idea was introduced that the state was the common good of the citizens, and the powers of the President were greatly expanded at the expense of the Senate and Sejm. Under the new articles, the President had the power to appoint 1/3rd of senators, the Commander-in-chief of the Polish Army, the Inspector General of the Armed Forces, and held the right to dismiss parliament and veto laws that were passed 'non-constructively'.\n\nThe president also had the authority to declare a successor in the event of an emergency or war. This became the basis for the Polish Government in Exile in the West. When Ignacy Mościcki was interned in Romanian Exile as the battle for Poland still raged on, Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski, Polish general and ambassador in Rome, was named the new President of Poland. One day later, Wieniawa-Dlugoszowski would abdicate under pressure from Władysław Sikorski and pass the mantle of the Presidency to him. But elsewhere in 1944, the Soviet-backed authorities in communist Poland rejected the constitution as invalid and operated under the 1921 March Constitution."

 poland.95.t:0 "2nd Military Mission to Japan"
 poland.95.d:0 "With a shared common enemy, Poland and Japan have long kept friendly foreign relations. In 1904 while the Russo-Japanese war raged on, Józef Piłsudski travelled to Tokyo to offer his assistance in organizing a Polish rebellion against Russia. Despite initial interest, such plans were rejected by the Japanese government on the insistence of Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's arch-rival, who thought such a rebellion would fail and waste Polish lives. With the creation of the newly formed Polish state after the Great War, Japan offered diplomatic cooperation and helped ethnic Poles escape from Russia and Siberia. In 1923, just after the Polish-Soviet war, a military mission was sent to Japan headed by Polish engineer, cryptologist, and military intelligence officer Jan Kowalewski. During his stay, Jan Kowalewski taught Japanese officers in Tokyo courses on radio intelligence and cryptanalysis. For his efforts, the Japanese government awarded Jan Kowalewski the 'Order of the Rising Sun'.\n\nNow we are planning to send Lieutenant Colonel Jan Kowalewski on a second military mission to Japan to offer more advanced technical assistance on code-breaking and cryptanalysis efforts. What do we want in return for our technical expertise?"

 poland.104.d:0 "For much of the early interwar period, relations between Poland and Czechoslovakia were fraught with constant border conflicts and tensions. Zaolzie with its valuable coal mines and railroad links was disputed between the two nations. A brief border war was fought in which Czechoslovakia managed to take control of most of the region; however, intervention by the Western Allies forced a withdrawal. Under Western supervision, ethnic plebicites were to be held, and the region would be divided. Both nations agreed to accept Allied deliberations; however, with the advent of the Polish-Soviet War and the Soviet advance on Warsaw, fears were raised among the Allies that a Polish defeat would result in the region falling into Bolshevik hands. The Spa Conference in July 1920 awarded lands to Czechoslovakia that included large Polish populations but left few Czechs under Polish rule. The conference decision left bitter feelings among the local Polish population who felt discriminated against by the Czech government."
