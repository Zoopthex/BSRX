Such high standards were intended to attract foreign buyers in order to acquire additional funds to further modernize Poland's military; however, such quality control was well above the standards of other European armies and even drew criticism from foreign advisors.\n\nSuch difference in opinion was demonstrated in one recorded meeting between Polish and French officials. Upon trying to impress French military leaders with examples of high-quality Polish weapons for potential purchase and export, the French delegation declined to buy. When pressed for further reasons why, one French officer replied 'France is simply too poor afford such weapons.' The Polish delegation left the meeting with a smug sense of superiority in their military's equipment standards while the pragmatically minded French shook their heads in disbelief."
