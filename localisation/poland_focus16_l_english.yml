 POL_Family_Sponsorship_Program_desc:0 "In an effort to promote traditional values and encourage large families, President Mościcki issued a decree that every seventh son in an indigenously Polish, unpruned family would become his godson. Among the families who met this strict requirement along with positive appraisals of their moral character, the President or vovoidship's senator would travel in person to attend the child's baptism. Moreover, the state would grant this seventh child very generous state benefits such as free education both domestically and in studying abroad, waivers for free public transportation for life, free healthcare vouchers for life, and a trust fund to provide savings for when the child came of age. In total, just under 1000 individuals qualified under this program, but it had far reaching effects in promoting Mościcki's public image as a sincere family man."

Members were called upon to defend faith and morality against anti-religious, subversive, anti-national, anti-social, and anti-state influences. Demands were placed for Polish education to be given a Catholic character, to reverse the secularization of marriage, and to repeal laws allowing divorce. With an emphasis on personal discipline, membership was widespread among the Polish middle classes, landowners, and intelligentsia."
