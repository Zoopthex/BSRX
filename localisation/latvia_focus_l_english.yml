 LATVIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After a long-fought struggle for independence from the Soviet Union and from a German puppet government, the new nation of Latvia was founded. What was once a great industrial center of the old Russian Empire, now found itself a depopulated post-war economic ruin. Through the interwar period, great strides have been made in rebuilding the country from the ashes of the Great War; however, with the advent of the Great Depression, democracy was recently discarded in favor of a benign dictatorship. Furthermore, concerns about potential German or Soviet aggression linger on the horizon, yet the Baltic States still dither on a unified foreign policy."

 LAT_Support_Lithuania_on_Vilnius_desc:0 "The city of Vilnius (Wilno in Polish) was the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. At the conclusion of the First World War, despite census results showing only 2% of inhabitants identified as Lithuanians, the city was still claimed on the grounds that many Polanized or Russified Lithuanians lived there. During the Polish-Soviet war, control of Vilnius changed hands multiple times, but eventually Soviet authorities finally handed over the city to Lithuania during their retreat. Conflict between Poland and Lithuania immediately followed, but the League of Nations intervened and negotiated a ceasefire. Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski immediately organized a mutiny among the predominantly ethnically-Polish 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division. The Republic of Central Lithuania was declared and soon annexed by Poland.\n\nSupport for Lithuania in the Baltic Entente excludes aggression from Poland over the issue of Vilnius. Lithuania's constitution still claims the city as their capital. We can take the decision to fully support Lithuania in the event Polish-Lithuanian tensions flare up over the issue."
