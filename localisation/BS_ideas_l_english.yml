And this is exactly what happened - squared pieces of land have been carved out of our country, now legally in Italian possession, defenseless against the imperialist exploitation of what little resources and manpower we had left there. We have been partitioned yet again, and nothing remains for us but to faintly hope that the Allies will be willing to help liberate our lands one day."
