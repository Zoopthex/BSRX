 poland.158.t:0 "The Nationalists Come to Power" #Bielecki Presidency
 poland.158.d:0 "The recent collapse of the BBWR and the continuing conflicts following the death of Józef Piłsudski could no longer stop Roman Dmowski's National Camp from winning the elections and taking power in the Republic. The National Assembly elected Tadeusz Bielecki, a faithful disciple and ideological successor of Roman Dmowski, as President of the Republic of Poland. President Bielecki together with the authorities of the National Party announce a series of political and social changes, which are to lead Poland to the greatness and finally reform it into the Catholic State of the Polish Nation."

 poland.159.d:0 "The recent collapse of the BBWR and the continuing conflicts following the death of Józef Piłsudski could no longer stop Roman Dmowski's National Camp from winning the elections and taking power in the Republic. The National Assembly elected Kazimierz Kowalski, a faithful disciple and ideological successor of Roman Dmowski, as President of the Republic of Poland. President Kowalski together with the authorities of the National Party announce a series of political and social changes, which are to lead Poland to the greatness and finally reform it into the Catholic State of the Polish Nation."
 poland.159.a:0 "Make Poland Great Again!"
 
 poland.213.t:0 "President Dissolve The Sejm"
 poland.213.d:0 "Today, President Mościcki shocked the government and public opinion, dissolved the Sejm and announced that he would announce the new term elections. The president argued his decision by the inability to build a stable government that could handle the great crisis effects and the ever-increasing strikes that are sweeping through the country. Public opinion and the opposition indicate that the president's decision is the result of internal fighting between the Sanacja camp and an attempt to remove the increasingly divided "colonels" camp from power. This will be the first election in several years in which the opposition will probably take part, so the mobilization among the opposition parties is large and the president's strange decision, as the public opinion puts it, may give the possibility to limit the Sanacja regime or even to finally liquidate it"."
 poland.213.a:0 "End of Regime ?"
 poland.214.t:0 "National Party Wins The Elections"
 poland.214.d:0 "The National Party wins the parliamentary elections by completely declassifying the opposition, Dmowski's camp triumphs and their activists and supporters gather in crowds on the streets of Polish cities. As the largest opposition party, the SN was predicted to be the winner but the nationalists were not expected to achieve such a good result. Large national rallies are sweeping through the country, both schoolchildren and students join in and chant the slogans: "Hail, Great Poland", "Long live Roman Dmowski". After years of political regime, the opposition enters the parliament and announces thorough reforms, it is undoubtedly the day of triumph of the national camp. Sanacja has suffered a terrible electoral defeat and most of its candidates did not get into the parliament. The nationalists are triumphing, while the socialists, agrarian's, christian democrats and national minorities cannot accept the defeat and are announcing the formation of a anti-nationalist coalition. \n\nMore surprising than the result of the election is the resignation of the current president Mościcki from office and his refusal to designate a presidential candidate! The president argued that his decision was based on the increasingly deteriorating state of health and the need to 'release' the political life of the country. One thing is certain, the Sanacja government is finally losing its power and the Electoral Assembly will proceed to elect the President of the Republic"."

 poland.215.d:0 "The Assembly of Electors has the task of electing the President of the Republic of Poland. According to the Constitution, the candidate will be selected by the: Marshals of both chambers of parliament, Prime Minister, First President of the Supreme Court, General Inspector of the Armed Forces and 75 electors, elected from among the most worthy citizens in 2/3 by the Sejm and 1/3 by the Senate. It is clear that the presidential candidate will be a representative of the National Party, which has the largest representation in both chambers of parliament. There are frictions and debates inside the SN, whether it is to be Tadeusz Bielecki or the current SN President Kazimierz Kowalski. The opposition, in the absence of an opportunity to put forward its own candidate, remains a passive observer, while for the SN it is a choice of their path of development and the direction of the state. The National Party faces a difficult task, who should become the President of the Republic?"."
