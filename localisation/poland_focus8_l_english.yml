 poland.161.d:0 "Born on December 1st, 1867 in Mierzanowo, Ignacy Mościcki was the son of a Polish landowner who had participated in the January Uprising of 1863. After studying chemistry at the Riga Technical University, he became affiliated with left-wing independence groups. He was forced to flee to London and subsequently travelled to Switzerland where he developed a patent for nitric acid production. Shortly after, he made acquaintance with Józef Piłsudski in the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). While staying in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Ignacy Mościcki became a specialist in electro-chemistry. After Piłsudski's May Coup d'État in 1926, Mościcki was elected to office of the Presidency starting on the 4th of June 1926.\n\nFollowing Piłsudski's death and the adoption of the April Constitution, controversy erupted over whether the current president had to stand for re-election under the new articles. Many predicted that if snap elections were held, Prime Minister Walery Sławek would be favored to win. President Mościcki assembled a team of lawyers and legal scholars to make a case that snap elections were unnecessary. Furthermore, he argued that the late Marshal Józef Piłsudski had given his personal blessing for Mościcki to continue the presidency. Thus the Castle political faction took its name from the Royal Castle in Warsaw which housed the embattled President."

Originally a chemist notable for his work in the nitrogen industry, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski served as the Minister of Industry and Trade from 1926 to 1930 and as the Minister of the Treasury from 1935 to 1939. Groomed by Mościcki to be a potential political successor, Kwiatkowski was the mastermind of the successful 4-year plan and the creation of the maritime seaport of Gdynia which began to reverse Poland's economic decline during the Great Depression."

The destruction of Polish property and loss of Polish lives only further eroded a culture under assault by imperial overlords. Instead, in an era of blooming Romanticism the nationalists adopted the view of organic work. Striving for work ethic, artistic contributions, and scientific discoveries were seen as the best methods of preserving Polish culture and territorial integrity. By encouraging individuals to seek out success in life, Polish culture would thus prove to be resilient at attempts to convert it.\n\nThis philosophy continued to be championed by the more moderate Polish nationalist parties in the 20th century. When Józef Piłsudski sought to organize a rebellion during the Russo-Japanese war, Roman Dmowski travelled to Japan and thwarted such plans believing it would be a waste of lives. In the Second Republic, Narodowa Demokracja sought to continue the traditions of organic work in advocating for market capitalism, investments in education, and cultural preservation."

 poland.168.d:0 "During the September invasion of Poland, various political parties in Poland organized their own independent efforts to support the war effort. Among PPS' most notable contributions were organizing the formation of volunteer worker's brigades in the defense of Warsaw. With the approval of General Walerian Czuma, PPS leaders began recruitment drives for citizens to take up shovels to help dig entrenchments and barricades around the city. Membership rapidly climbed into the thousands over the course of the siege, and their role expanded to include assisting in communications and intelligence gathering. Such was the dedication of these units that when surrender was announced, many intially refused to surrender and threatened to shoot their officers for cowardice."

Overtime the program has transformed into an offensive tool to use in the event of war with the Soviet Union. Special Polish units commanded by chosen officers train to conduct sabotage and intelligence gathering activities behind enemy lines. Over the last few decades, the Polish-Soviet border has been tense with both sides sending spies across."

 poland.169.d:0 "With a shared common enemy, Poland and Japan have long kept friendly foreign relations. In 1904 while the Russo-Japanese war raged on, Józef Piłsudski travelled to Tokyo to offer his assistance in organizing a Polish rebellion against Russia. Despite initial interest, such plans were rejected by the Japanese government on the insistence of Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's arch-rival, who thought such a rebellion would fail and waste Polish lives. With the creation of the newly formed Polish state after the Great War, Japan offered diplomatic cooperation and helped ethnic Poles escape from Russia and Siberia. In 1923, just after the Polish-Soviet war, a military mission was sent to Japan headed by Polish engineer, cryptologist, and military intelligence officer Jan Kowalewski. During his stay, Jan Kowalewski taught Japanese officers in Tokyo courses on radio intelligence and cryptanalysis. For his efforts, the Japanese government awarded Jan Kowalewski the 'Order of the Rising Sun'."
