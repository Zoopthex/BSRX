 poland.109.d:0 "In the interwar years, the Department of Artillery under the Polish Ministry of National Defence ordered the development of a device that could detect dud artillery shells on military training grounds. The AVA Radio Company completed the design of such a device, but it never entered into production due to the September Invasion. The Polish Army in Exile in France later reinvisioned the device as a mine detector. The final version was created by Polish Lieutenant Józef Kosacki who donated the blueprint to the British Army. The newly developed man-portable land mine detector was first used in the Battle of El Alamein where 500 detectors helped clear the way for the advance of the British Eighth Army. Over the course of the war, more than 100,000 units would be produced, and the same model would remain in service until the 1991 Gulf War."

 poland.213.d:0 "Today, President Mościcki shocked the government and public opinion, dissolved the Sejm and announced that he would announce the new term elections. The president argued his decision by the inability to build a stable government that could handle the great crisis effects and the ever-increasing strikes that are sweeping through the country. Public opinion and the opposition indicate that the president's decision is the result of internal fighting between the Sanacja camp and an attempt to remove the increasingly divided "colonels" camp from power. This will be the first election in several years in which the opposition will probably take part, so the mobilization among the opposition parties is large and the president's strange decision, as the public opinion puts it, may give the possibility to limit the Sanacja regime or even to finally liquidate it"."

 poland.214.t:0 "National Party Wins The Elections"
 poland.214.d:0 "The National Party wins the parliamentary elections by completely declassifying the opposition, Dmowski's camp triumphs and their activists and supporters gather in crowds on the streets of Polish cities. As the largest opposition party, the SN was predicted to be the winner but the nationalists were not expected to achieve such a good result. Large national rallies are sweeping through the country, both schoolchildren and students join in and chant the slogans: "Hail, Great Poland", "Long live Roman Dmowski". After years of political regime, the opposition enters the parliament and announces thorough reforms, it is undoubtedly the day of triumph of the national camp. Sanacja has suffered a terrible electoral defeat and most of its candidates did not get into the parliament. The nationalists are triumphing, while the socialists, agrarian's, christian democrats and national minorities cannot accept the defeat and are announcing the formation of a anti-nationalist coalition. \n\nMore surprising than the result of the election is the resignation of the current president Mościcki from office and his refusal to designate a presidential candidate! The president argued that his decision was based on the increasingly deteriorating state of health and the need to 'release' the political life of the country. One thing is certain, the Sanacja government is finally losing its power and the Electoral Assembly will proceed to elect the President of the Republic"."

It is clear that the presidential candidate will be a representative of the National Party, which has the largest representation in both chambers of parliament. There are frictions and debates inside the SN, whether it is to be Tadeusz Bielecki or the current SN President Kazimierz Kowalski. The opposition, in the absence of an opportunity to put forward its own candidate, remains a passive observer, while for the SN it is a choice of their path of development and the direction of the state.

Such high standards were intended to attract foreign buyers in order to acquire additional funds to further modernize Poland's military; however, such quality control was well above the standards of other European armies and even drew criticism from foreign advisors.\n\nSuch difference in opinion was demonstrated in one recorded meeting between Polish and French officials. Upon trying to impress French military leaders with examples of high-quality Polish weapons for potential purchase and export, the French delegation declined to buy. When pressed for further reasons why, one French officer replied 'France is simply too poor afford such weapons.'

The Socialist Action militia wore navy blue uniforms and swore an oath of absolute obediance to the party. Through youth groups, trade unions, and eventual expanded membership to female units, enrollment in the organization grew to over ten thousand members. Socialist Action units trained in urban combat, sabotage, and espionage activities. As the threat of the second world war loomed, an agreement of cooperation was established with the Polish army for the Socialist Action to particpate in subversive activities in support of the armed forces. Socialist Action's urban combat expertise would later form the basis for the creation of the Workers' Defense Brigades during the siege of Warsaw and then in the left-leaning resistance group, the WRN People's Guard."

 poland.161.d:0 "Born on December 1st, 1867 in Mierzanowo, Ignacy Mościcki was the son of a Polish landowner who had participated in the January Uprising of 1863. After studying chemistry at the Riga Technical University, he became affiliated with left-wing independence groups. He was forced to flee to London and subsequently travelled to Switzerland where he developed a patent for nitric acid production. Shortly after, he made acquaintance with Józef Piłsudski in the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). While staying in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Ignacy Mościcki became a specialist in electro-chemistry. After Piłsudski's May Coup d'État in 1926, Mościcki was elected to office of the Presidency starting on the 4th of June 1926.\n\nFollowing Piłsudski's death and the adoption of the April Constitution, controversy erupted over whether the current president had to stand for re-election under the new articles. Many predicted that if snap elections were held, Prime Minister Walery Sławek would be favored to win. President Mościcki assembled a team of lawyers and legal scholars to make a case that snap elections were unnecessary. Furthermore, he argued that the late Marshal Józef Piłsudski had given his personal blessing for Mościcki to continue the presidency. Thus the Castle political faction took its name from the Royal Castle in Warsaw which housed the embattled President."

Originally a chemist notable for his work in the nitrogen industry, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski served as the Minister of Industry and Trade from 1926 to 1930 and as the Minister of the Treasury from 1935 to 1939. Groomed by Mościcki to be a potential political successor, Kwiatkowski was the mastermind of the successful 4-year plan and the creation of the maritime seaport of Gdynia which began to reverse Poland's economic decline during the Great Depression."

The destruction of Polish property and loss of Polish lives only further eroded a culture under assault by imperial overlords. Instead, in an era of blooming Romanticism the nationalists adopted the view of organic work. Striving for work ethic, artistic contributions, and scientific discoveries were seen as the best methods of preserving Polish culture and territorial integrity. By encouraging individuals to seek out success in life, Polish culture would thus prove to be resilient at attempts to convert it.\n\nThis philosophy continued to be championed by the more moderate Polish nationalist parties in the 20th century. When Józef Piłsudski sought to organize a rebellion during the Russo-Japanese war, Roman Dmowski travelled to Japan and thwarted such plans believing it would be a waste of lives. In the Second Republic, Narodowa Demokracja sought to continue the traditions of organic work in advocating for market capitalism, investments in education, and cultural preservation."

With the creation of the newly formed Polish state after the Great War, Japan offered diplomatic cooperation and helped ethnic Poles escape from Russia and Siberia. In 1923, just after the Polish-Soviet war, a military mission was sent to Japan headed by Polish engineer, cryptologist, and military intelligence officer Jan Kowalewski.

Whereas Józef Piłsudski saw Poland as a diverse coalition of various cultures and ethnicities, Roman Dmowski's nationalists saw Poland as a nation of Poles first and foremost. When Poland was partitioned in the late 18th century, the nationalist movement arose to resist the Germanization of former western Polish lands. With academic and literary groups forming the basis of Polish resistance to outside influence, the nationalist movement in Poland thus came to encompass the more educated and middle classes in Poland.\n\n National Democracy encouraged minority groups to either assimilate or emigrate from the country. Policy platforms included the institution of mandatory education policies for Polish culture and incentives for Poles to settle within non-Polish speaking parts of the country. The influence of the nationalists led to tension and occasional race riots among various ethnic groups in the early interwar period who resented such pressure. Such scattered violence only reinforced Roman Dmowski's views that minority groups posed a threat to Poland's stability. His foreign policy aims stipulated that only territories containing significant Polish speaking populations--many residing in Germany--were worthy of acquisition."

 poland.141.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, two primary Ukranian states formed: the West Ukrainian People's Republic in Eastern Galicia and the Ukrainian People's Republic in Kiev. Relations between the two nations deterioated as the former saw the Poles as the primary enemy whereas the latter saw Poland as a potential ally against the Soviets and White Russian armies. By July 1919, Poland had conquered much of Galicia and the Western Ukranian People's Republic ceased to exist. In the east, the Ukrainian People's Republic became the Directorate of Ukraine, a temporary ruling body until a new government could be government could be elected. Symon Petliura, head of the Directorate, withdrew to Poland and signed an alliance in Warsaw which recognized Poland's ownership of Galicia in exchange for military assistance. Józef Piłsudski saw Ukraine as a potential partner in realizing his Intermarium Project of a coalition of various nations joined together in an equal union. With the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War, an offensive by Poland and Symon Petliura's two remaining divisions captured the city of Kiev before the fortune of war turned, which saw the Soviets reach the gates of Warsaw after which the tide of the war turned again. With the conclusion of the Polish-Soviet war, the Directorate became a government-in-exile based in Tarnów under the close watch of Polish authorities. Many officers of the Directorate's military subsequently were inducted into the Polish army. After Symon Petliura was assassinated by a Bolshevik agent in Paris, leadership of the Directorate passed to Andriy Livytskyi who continued cooperation with Polish authorities."

Despite widespread support among various factions, the Lithuanian government proved to be hostile to the idea. A failed Lithuanian military coup was even launched by the Polish government in 1919 as an attempt to instate a friendly regime. But with the area now under Polish control, a new joint administration is already being formed. Across towns in Poland and in some scattered places around Lithuania, celebrations and church bells are resounding in a joyful chorus celebrating the historic moment of reunification."

Although the measure failed to pass, the idea of a three-way commonwealth emerged once again during the doomed January Uprising in 1863-1864 aginst the Russian Empire. The underground Polish National Government adopted the colors and insignia of all three nations. In the 20th century, Józef Piłsudski had hoped that the Kiev offensive in the Polish-Soviet war would lead the creation of a union between Poland and Ukraine as part of his Intermarium project. The capture of the city on May 7, 1920 seemed to almost realize his dreams; however, the fortune of the war turned, and thus the project was never fully realized. However, with Kiev now officially under Polish proxy, the Sanacja government can finally bring the late Piłsudski's dream into reality."

 poland.110.t:0 "The National Defense Fund"
 poland.110.d:0 "In the interwar years Poland was agriculturally self-sufficient, but her state industries and military production were dependent upon considerable foreign imports of raw materials. Thus when the Great Depression struck, countries around the world acted to quickly devalue their currencies; however, the National Bank of Poland kept the value of the Polish złoty strong. A strong currency exacerbated deflation and lowered the amount of foreign reserves available to help the economy, but provided an advantage for purchasing goods from abroad.\n\nTo make the best of the situation, the Polish government created the National Defense Fund. State assets were sold, donations were solicited from citizens living abroad, and fundraisers were setup at home to raise capital, which in turn could purchase raw materials or armaments abroad. Schools, institutions, and parishes were encouraged to donate towards goals such funding the purchase of a machine gun, an artillery piece, or even an airplane. In 1937, the War Office collected 2,330,380 złoty and 6,645 tons of scrap metal. 36 airplanes, 615 heavy machine guns, 130 light machine guns, and various other armaments too numerous to list were acquired. The submarine ORP Orzeł was also commissioned in part thanks to public funds. A presidential decree also went out that all private property was subject to requisition as a contingency in the case of war. This was followed by a second decree in 1938 which tightened state control over agriculture production and made all vehicles and livestock liable for requisition."

The subborness of the nationalist faction would later cause great annoyance and irritation to Piłsudski when Dmowski publically spoke out against the inclusion of Minsk during the negoations to end the Polish-Soviet war.\n\nIn the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the Polish delegation submitted its proposal for the theoretical borders of the newly created Polish state. This proposal was called the Dmowski Line. The Dmowski line looked westward and included all of Upper Silesia, parts of Pomeralia, and southern West Prussia. Dmowski admitted that Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds and on the argument that the Polish minority in the area was highly educated and thus culturally significant. Even with French backing and support, Dmowski would end up disappointed by the Treaty of Versailles which placed the Polish-German border further east than he had hoped for. Out of these negotiations, Dmowski became a bitter enemy of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and accused him of accepting German and Jewish bribes to take an unfavorable stance towards Poland."
