Production of the TK-3 began in 1931. In 1933, a newer design, the TKS, with a better engine and redesigned hull was introduced. Both the TK-3 and TKS were armed with a Ckm wz. 25 Hotchkiss machinegun as armament only."

It was designed to be armed with a 20 mm nkm wz. 38 FK autocannon and one Ckm wz. 30 machine gun. At the time of its projected design completion in 1936, the Polish army deemed it obsolete and skipped production in favor of the upcoming 7TP tank."

Although technically superior to any of the German light tanks of the September invasion, only 150 units were produced in time--too few to change the outcome of the war."
