 poland.158.t:0 "The Nationalists Come to Power"
 poland.158.d:0 "The BBWR coalition was originally created in part to keep National Democracy from obtaining political power. However, its recent decline and constant infighting since Józef Piłsudski's death could no longer prevent Roman Dmowski's party from riding a wave of sudden popular support for change. Decrying the recent April Constitution as undemocratic and a shameful power grab, the new nationalist coalition promises to decentralize the powers of government and usher in a new parliamentary system led by the people."
 poland.158.a:0 "Make Poland Great Again!"
 poland.159.t:0 "The Forced Polonization of Minorities"
 poland.159.d:0 "The divide between the Sanacja and Endecja movements represented a fundamental split over what constituted the Polish nation. Whereas Józef Piłsudski saw Poland as a diverse coalition of various cultures and ethnicities, Roman Dmowski's nationalists saw Poland as a nation of Poles first and foremost. When Poland was partitioned in the late 18th century, the nationalist movement arose to resist the Germanization of former western Polish lands. With academic and literary groups forming the basis of Polish resistance to outside influence, the nationalist movement in Poland thus came to encompass the more educated and middle classes in Poland.\n\n National Democracy encouraged minority groups to either assimilate or emigrate from the country. Policy platforms included the institution of mandatory education policies for Polish culture and incentives for Poles to settle within non-Polish speaking parts of the country. The influence of the nationalists led to tension and occasional race riots among various ethnic groups in the early interwar period who resented such pressure. Such scattered violence only reinforced Roman Dmowski's views that minority groups posed a threat to Poland's stability. His foreign policy aims stipulated that only territories containing significant Polish speaking populations--many residing in Germany--were worthy of acquisition."
 poland.159.a:0 "Poland is a nation of Poles."
 poland.160.t:0 "The Segregation of Minorities"
 poland.160.d:0 "With the National Radical Camp firmly in power, new government policies to mold society are underway. With increasing frequency organized gangs of supporters in uniform have begun making rounds in Polish cities smashing windows and looting minority-owned shops. Unofficially, but secretly planned by the government, non-Polish speaking people are increasingly forced to live in seperate and isolated communities. Such actions are part of the government's plan to realize a specific vision of a new homogeneous Greater Poland."
 poland.160.a:0 "Separate and unequal."
