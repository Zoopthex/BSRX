 latvia.1.t:0 "The Story so Far - Road to Independence"
 latvia.1.d:0 "Prior to the outbreak of the Great War, Latvia was among the most industrialized centers of the Russian Empire. Latvian ports accounted for 25% of Russian trade throughput, earning the nickname "The Belgium of the East". However, by the summer of 1915, fighting between the Central Powers and the Russian empire reached the Baltic region. Much of the population and industry were relocated into other parts of the Russian Empire. Riga, a city with a population of 517,000 residents and the 5th largest city in the Russian Empire, fell to 181,000 inhabitants after the war with only a few Latvians being able to return to their homeland afterwards.\n\nAs the Great War continued, ethnic Lativians were consolidated into special Latvian units to better mount a defense of the Baltic region against the Central Powers. During the Russian Revolution, loyalty among Latvian units was mixed with some fighting for the communist cause and others for an independent and nationalist Latvian homeland. Due to local sympathies, much of the Latvian countryside fell under occupation of the Bolsheviks; however, a combined nationalist Latvian and German volunteer presence held onto a small enclave around the port city of Liepāja. Eventually with the assistance of German volunteers and Polish forces, Latvia was liberated and established as an independent nation. The Soviet Union would recognize Latvia's independence on August 11, 1920 and by the Western Allied Powers on January 26, 1921. Membership into the League of Nations soon followed on September 22, 1921."

 latvia.2.t:0 "The Story so Far - Early Interwar Latvia"
 latvia.2.d:0 "The newly formed Latvian state was comprised of 75% ethnic Latvians. Despite constitutional guarantees and the introduction of a democratic system of government, tensions remained between Latvians and other ethnic groups. Latvian politics would become divided between several blocs: a nationalistic right-wing, rural agrarians, a democratic center, and an alliance of minority groups.\n\nAfter the Great War, despite big strides in improving Latvia's railroad network, in creating a robust electronics industry, and in achieving one of the Europe's highest literacy rates, Latvia experienced a dramatic shift away from its highly urbanized pre-war demographics. In 1920, farms over 100 hectares were divided among native farmers and veterans of the Latvian war for independence. Many of these estates were part of the traditional German landowning class and such agrarian reforms alienated them from the rest of Latvian society. Chronic rural poverty across the country would soon follow as many of these newer farms were too small to be productive. The Great Depression worsened the economic situation with unemployment eventually reaching 46% in 1932. Economic concerns would further agitate more demands for economic redistribution and for relief in the rural areas."

 latvia.3.t:0 "The Story so Far - Ulmanis Coup"
 latvia.3.d:0 "In the Latvian parliament (Saeima), no minimum threshold for party entry existed. Such a system of many small parties caused difficulty in forming ruling majorities and created instability in the political system. Although the Social Democrats won parliamentary elections with Paul Kalniņš serving as Speaker of the Saeima from 1925 to 1934, they were never able to be part of the ruling coalition due to marxist parties being unwilling to cooperate.\n\nOn November 10, 1933, Kārlis Ulmanis' Latvian Farmers' Union, the second biggest political party, proposed reforms to the consitution to strengthen the Presidency. Although the Social Democrats were initially cooperative, negotiations broke down over minor details. Before the next set of parliamentary elections, then prime minister, Kārlis Ulmanis decided to launch a coup against the government.\n\nOn 15 May 1934, Kārlis Ulmanis along with Minister of the Interior Vilis Gulbis, and Minister of War Janis Balodis orchestrated their coup. Sympathetic elements in the Aizsargi militia seized control of important buildings throughout the country in a bloodless coup. A state of emergency was declared, all political parties--even the Latvian Farmers' Union--were disbanded, and important members of opposition parties were jailed. Opponents of Ulman's leadership were offered to cooperate and work in non-political positions. The President Alberts Kviesis did not act to oppose the coup and served the rest of his term as a figurehead approving all decisions made by Kārlis Ulmanis and his small group of trusted advisors."

 latvia.4.t:0 "The Story so Far - The Present Situation"
 latvia.4.d:0 "Kārlis Ulmanis' regime introduced a wipespread system of state capitalism and corporatism. Many failing private enterprises were placed under government control in the hopes of returning them to a state of profitability. Income from these businesses were in turn used for further acquisitions and large publics works projects. The level of state control in the economy became second to only the Soviet Union. The 'Ulamanis times' eventually became associated with general prosperity as the new regime succeeded in placing Latvia on the road to economic recovery. Popular support surged for the dictatorship.\n\nOn the international stage, Latvia was concerned over potential aggression from Germany the Soviet Union. Among the Baltic States, the Baltic Entente was formed out of several diplomatic and security agreements. On October, 1935, Latvia was given a rotating seat on the Council of the League and represented the Baltic bloc's interests. The Baltic Entente, however, stopped just short of becoming a full-fledged miltiary alliance. Problems with Lithuania's disputes over the city of Vilnius (Wilno) proved too difficult to overcome, and Lithuania's occupation of Memel worried other Baltic members that they could be dragged into war with Germany. Despite these international concerns, the Latvian military's development was neglected in favor of internal economic growth. The Aizsargi paramilitary militia would instead be favored, and their ranks were expanded for mass mobilization eventually outnumbering the army itself."

 latvia.5.t:0 "The End of Alberts Kveisis' Term"
 latvia.5.d:0 "One of the promises made by Kārlis Ulmanis upon seizing power after the 1934 coup was that a new constitution would eventually be drafted. Such a promise was never fulfilled. The current constituation stipulates that the chairman of the Saeima would become acting president pending new elections, but the 4th Saeima has long been dissolved. The presidential cabinet inherited the powers of the old Saeima; however, Alberts Kviesis himself is not a supporter of the coup and merely collaborates. With Alberts Kveisis' presidential term ending very soon, the question of what should happen next remains unanswered..."
