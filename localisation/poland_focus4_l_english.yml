 poland.129.d:0 "Lithuania severed its diplomatic ties with Poland after the Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski staged a mutiny in Lithuania on October 1920 by order of Józef Piłsudski. He invaded Lithuanian-held territory and captured the disputed city of Vilnius (Wilno in Polish). Due to Lithuania's decision to occupy Memel in January 1923, the League of Nations awarded Vilnius to Poland in March 1923. Despite the fact that only 2% of Wilno's population was Lithuanian speaking, the Lithuanian constitution still claims Wilno as its capital. Recently though, a Polish border guard was shot on the border. Protests have errupted in Polish cities demanding war with Lithuania."

 poland.138.d:0 "Under the threat of force, [From.GetNameDef] is demanding that we cede the city of Minsk and its surrounding territories. They claim that Minsk is a historical Polish city and thus they have a just claim to it. How shall we respond?"

 poland.138.b:0 "Preposterous."
 poland.139.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Surrenders Minsk"

 poland.141.t:0 "The Directorate of Ukraine"
 poland.141.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, two primary Ukranian states formed: the West Ukrainian People's Republic in Eastern Galicia and the Ukrainian People's Republic in Kiev. Relations between the two nations deterioated as the former saw the Poles as the primary enemy whereas the latter saw Poland as a potential ally against the Soviets and White Russian armies. By July 1919, Poland had conquered much of Galicia and the Western Ukranian People's Republic ceased to exist. In the east, the Ukrainian People's Republic became the Directorate of Ukraine, a temporary ruling body until a new government could be government could be elected. Symon Petliura, head of the Directorate, withdrew to Poland and signed an alliance in Warsaw which recognized Poland's ownership of Galicia in exchange for military assistance. Józef Piłsudski saw Ukraine as a potential partner in realizing his Intermarium Project of a coalition of various nations joined together in an equal union. With the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War, an offensive by Poland and Symon Petliura's two remaining divisions captured the city of Kiev before the fortune of war turned, which saw the Soviets reach the gates of Warsaw after which the tide of the war turned again. With the conclusion of the Polish-Soviet war, the Directorate became a government-in-exile based in Tarnów under the close watch of Polish authorities. Many officers of the Directorate's military subsequently were inducted into the Polish army. After Symon Petliura was assassinated by a Bolshevik agent in Paris, leadership of the Directorate passed to Andriy Livytskyi who continued cooperation with Polish authorities."
 poland.141.a:0 "The glory of Ukraine has not yet perished."
 poland.142.t:0 "The Recreation of the Ukranian Army"
 poland.142.d:0 "From volunteers, exiles, and former members of the Ukrainian People's Army we have formed a new army for the Directorate. Though small in size, they will prove useful in consolidating local support in the event war breaks out again with the Soviet Union. As more Ukranian territory is recaptured by our forces, they will certainly grow considerably in size."
 poland.142.a:0 "The Intermarium's newest member."
 poland.143.t:0 "Call-in Japan to War?"
 poland.143.d:0 "Japan is honor-bound to come to our aid in the event the Soviet Union declares war on us. Do we want to call upon their commitments?"

 poland.146.t:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth"
 poland.146.d:0 "Józef Piłsudski and the Sanacja government held the lofty dream of one day reforming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite widespread support among various factions, the Lithuanian government proved to be hostile to the idea. A failed Lithuanian military coup was even launched by the Polish government in 1919 as an attempt to instate a friendly regime. But with the area now under Polish control, a new joint administration is already being formed. Across towns in Poland and in some scattered places around Lithuania, celebrations and church bells are resounding in a joyful chorus celebrating the historic moment of reunification."
 poland.146.a:0 "Together at last."
 poland.147.t:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth"
 poland.147.d:0 "The idea of a Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth consisting of three equal nations originated in the 17th century when the Polish Sejm debated the creation of a Duchy of Ruthenia. Although the measure failed to pass, the idea of a three-way commonwealth emerged once again during the doomed January Uprising in 1863-1864 aginst the Russian Empire. The underground Polish National Government adopted the colors and insignia of all three nations. In the 20th century, Józef Piłsudski had hoped that the Kiev offensive in the Polish-Soviet war would lead the creation of a union between Poland and Ukraine as part of his Intermarium project. The capture of the city on May 7, 1920 seemed to almost realize his dreams; however, the fortune of the war turned, and thus the project was never fully realized. However, with Kiev now officially under Polish proxy, the Sanacja government can finally bring the late Piłsudski's dream into reality."
