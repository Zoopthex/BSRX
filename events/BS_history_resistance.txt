#This is for next update.
#All of these are against Nazi Germany.
#Yugoslavia will always have crazy partisans. Poland's resistance will start 1 year after it capitulates to Germany. Czechoslovakia's will start 6 months after it dies.
#France will start 1 year after turning into Free France.
#The USSR's resistance will start once either A) it's after January 1, 1941 or B) Germany has declared war on the USSR.
#USSR resistance will get worse over time in spans of years. One year after the war starts, the USSR will get crazier partisans. It continues on every year.

#Make sure all of the events are hidden events. This ensures that they won't be seen by players nor the AI or what not.
